    <ol>


        <li> 
            <p> I always follow you around, everywhere you go at night. I look very bright to people, but I can make the sun dark. I can be in many different forms and shapes. What am I? </p>
            <br>
            <p> The moon! </p>
        </li>

        <li> 
            <p> It can't be seen, can't be felt, can't be heard, and can't be smelt. It lies behind stars and under hills, And empty holes it fills. It comes first and follows after, Ends life, and kills laughter. What is it? </p>
            <br>
            <p> The dark. </p>
        </li>

        <li> 
            <p> I run in and out of town all day and night. What am I? </p>
            <br>
            <p> A road. </p>
        </li>

        <li> 
            <p> I was carried into a dark room, and set on fire. I wept, and then my head was cut off. What am I? </p>
            <br>
            <p> A Candle. </p>
        </li>

        <li> 
            <p> How do you know that a vampire loves baseball? </p>
            <br>
            <p> Because he turns into a bat every night. </p>
        </li>

        <li> 
            <p> When I point up it's bright, but when I point down it's dark. What am I? </p>
            <br>
            <p> A Light Switch. </p>
        </li>

        <li> 
            <p> Lovely and round, I shine with pale light, grown in the darkness, A lady's delight. What am I? </p>
            <br>
            <p> A Pearl. </p>
        </li>

        <li> 
            <p> I follow you by day, by night I blend right in but no one sees me except when I'm in the light. What am I? </p>
            <br>
            <p> A shadow. </p>
        </li>

        <li> 
            <p> What do ghosts like to do on a Saturday night? </p>
            <br>
            <p> BOOGIE. </p>
        </li>

        <li> 
            <p> I can fly but have no wings. I can cry but I have no eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I? </p>
            <br>
            <p> Clouds. </p>
        </li>
