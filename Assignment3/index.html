            I'm an asian american first generation child. Born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island I grew up in a conservative family of 8 people. Surrounded by a lot of artists and gamers, I grew to have a passion for art and gaming. I drew a lot of comics when I was a kid, now its quicker to draw on paper. Deep fried food has been my favorite as well as reading books and working on my education. Now I attend college at New England Institute Technology.
