    <!--Part 1-->
    <!--2 paragraph bio about yourself-->
    <p>
        Born as a Novemeber baby and raised in Rhode Island, I was the second child as a citizen of the United State of my family's first generation. 
        My mother and father moved to the United States from overseas of Southeast Asia to live a better life for their children and their relatives. 
        Due to the fact that my parents spoke a language other than English, I became a bilingual speaker of Hmong and English.

    <p> I grew up with a passion of art and gaming. 
        My family's activities were fondly a lot of drawing on paper and gaming on their playstation.
